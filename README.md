## About

	Why do I call my network Meunier Data Center? I call it that because I host a NAS, hypervisor, and network rack which all work together to maneuver data not only locally but elsewhere through web services such as DigitalOcean or through my locally hosted web server also known as https://www.joshuameunier.com.

	Here I will document everything about my home network, excluding any passwords or other sensitive materials.

## Network Hardware

1. HP T620 Plus with HP 4-port NIC card (1)
