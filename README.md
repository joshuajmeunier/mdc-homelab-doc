Meunier Data Center Home Lab Documentation

## About
	Why do I call my network Meunier Data Center? I call it that because I host a NAS, hypervisor, and network rack which all work together to maneuver data not only locally but elsewhere through web services such as DigitalOcean or through my locally hosted web server also known as https://www.joshuameunier.com.

	Here I will document everything about my home network, excluding any passwords or other sensitive materials.
